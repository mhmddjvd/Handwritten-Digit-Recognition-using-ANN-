# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-ANN-
This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The work is inspired by a research paper and aims to reproduce its methodology while exploring practical aspects of ANN-based classification. The model is trained on a dataset of human handwritten digits.
