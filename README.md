# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-ANN-
This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The work is inspired by a research paper and aims to reproduce its methodology while exploring practical aspects of ANN-based classification. The model is trained on a dataset of human handwritten digits.

Handwritten Digit Recognition using ANN

This project implements a **handwritten digit recognition system** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.
The implementation is based on a research paper and trained/tested with the **MNIST handwritten digit dataset**. The goal is to show how a simple feed-forward neural network can classify digits (0â€“9).

ðŸ§  Model Architecture

* **Input layer:** 784 nodes (28Ã—28 pixel images)
* **Hidden layer:** 200 nodes
* **Output layer:** 10 nodes (digits 0â€“9)
* **Activation function:** Sigmoid
* **Learning rate:** 0.1

ðŸ“‚ Project Contents

* Jupyter Notebook with ANN implementation
* MNIST dataset files (train & test)
    Google Drive Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iJFx6DUl8ifZ5inlW1SBQq4uF-QlzV9M/view?usp=sharing
* Reference research paper (PDF)

ðŸš€ Features

* ANN implementation from scratch with NumPy
* Training and testing on MNIST
* Backpropagation for weight updates
* Visualization of training/testing performance

ðŸ“Š Results

The trained model achieves **XX% accuracy** on the MNIST test dataset (replace XX with your result).

ðŸŽ¯ Future Work

* Experiment with different hidden layer sizes
* Compare with CNN-based approaches
* Extend to other handwriting datasets
